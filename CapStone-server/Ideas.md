# Ideas

## Music Rating site 
- large music database
- Users can sign in
- Users will be able to mark albums/songs they have listened to, and it will be added to a personal list
  - they can rate these albums based on lyrics, instrumentals, vocals, performance, impression, originality
  - These will all culminate into a single overall rating for the album
  - the rating for the album will be compared to other rating and will use a Bayesian system to calculate a fair rating overall
    - this ensures that popularity doesn't count as the main factor of a rating
- I will then curate lists for that will show off users rated top albums that may be organized in
  - top overall albums
  - top albums in specific genres
  - top albums of specific artist
  - top in a release year
  - etc.
- Users can use these lists to find new albums that have been rated by the community
- I may also implement lists that a user can make for albums they want to listen to 
- I may also implement a feature to be able to put if they own the album physically
  - vinyls, cds, cassettes, hit clips()
- The app will be a place to keep track of albums, express people thoughts on albums, and be able to find new music that others recommend 

## THE CAR BLUEPRINT
- Helps users keep track of their project car plans
- This app will focus on car enthusiasts who love to tinker on their cars
- the app will allow them to document, plan, and track progress on their builds
- they may also be able to share updates with the community and receive feedback
- they can maybe tag videos (like how to videos) to parts to get to later
- database will store profiles, car modification plans, parts details(type, price, etc.), maybe supplier info for parts
- This will let users manage costs, create a checklist to go through while building, stretch: allow for questions/feedback
- netlify(look into)
- API https://rapidapi.com/makingdatameaningful/api/auto-parts-catalog
- might have to hard code path into website for happy path of an example or demo 
- SVG-enhanced UI https://dev10.udemy.com/course/learn-web-animation-with-svg-and-gsap/
- tailwind CSS https://dev10.udemy.com/course/tailwind-css-zero-to-hero/
